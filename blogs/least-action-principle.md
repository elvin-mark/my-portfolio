# Least Action Principle

When I learned for the very first time about the Least Action Principle, I was amazed at how useful it was and how beautifully it compressed so much in a very simple equation, but at the same time I had a lot of questions on how it was derived and what it actually meant. So after thinking a lot for so many years, I have come to my own interpretation to which I feel comfortable with and I wanted to share it here.

## The traditional way

$$\delta S = 0$$

$$S = \int L(\dot{q}_i,q_i,t) dt$$

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i} - \frac{d}{dt}(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}) = 0$$

$$L = T - V$$

## But, what is action?
